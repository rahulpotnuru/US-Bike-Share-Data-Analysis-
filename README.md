Udacity-Project  US-Bikeshare-Data-Analysis
Description
This project requires you to explore data related to three major bikeshare systems or companies from the United States.

This process will be done using a Jupyter Notebook.
The code should run w/o errors.
Appropriate use of
data structures/types
loops/conditional statements
Packages
functions
coding practices (i.e. Docstrings, comments, variable names & general readability)
Analysis
Pose two questions about the data
Inspect the structure of the original data (very important)
Clean the data
Answer questions about the data using descriptive statistics
Visualize the data (instead of using plt use seaborn or ggplot)
Perform additional exploratory analysis
Consider where data analysis can be applied to other fields
Steps
Download relevant information (Done)
Familiarize myself with the data (Done)
Pose some questions that can be answered by simple analysis (Done)
Consider what information I will need to do said analysis (Done)
Carry out analysis (Done)
Convert ipynb to PDF - nbconvert package
Submission
iPython notebook will be shared as a PDF document. Make sure to cite all appropriate sources. (Contained within this README)
